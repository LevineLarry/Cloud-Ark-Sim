Use more accurate integration algorithm

Ship
	Ship Flight Computer:
		Communicates with command center over ShipCommunicationProtocol
		Carries out commands, such as "exert x joules of impulse in y direction"
			Determines how to best carry out command. Which direction will get the most thrusters inline?

Create ShipCommunicationProtocol
	Each ship is given a reference to this, which is passed to a ShipFlightComputer class
		Allows ShipFlightComputers to communicate with SpaceTrafficControl

Create SpaceTrafficControl
	Uses ShipCommunicationProtocol to broadcast commands to ShipFlightComputer's, which then control their ships accordingly

Create OrbitPredictor
	Can look into the future to compare the position of 2 bodies at a given time. Has margin of error which increases as time goes on (to simulate observational error)

Allow Sim.cs to simulate orbits

Randomly spawn asteroids into random orbits

Figure out how to create 3d view
	Unreal engine & communicate over socket?
	Website & communicate over websocket?
