# Cloud-Ark-Sim

This is a simulator of the "Cloud Ark" from the science fiction novel, "Seven Eves". In the book, a fleet of thousands of ships are launched into 
orbit to form a "Cloud Ark", a "formation" of these ships, similar to a Starlink Train. This sim is fairly high fidelity, simulating the ISP of the 
thrusters, the fuel & oxidizer they use, how the ships mass changes over time as they expend fuel, and how that then goes on to affect their moment 
of inertia when manuvering. Manuvering of the ships uses a PID controller to allow for smooth orientation changes.
